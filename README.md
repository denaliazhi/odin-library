### A digital library for people caught in the past
![Library](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/403aa3fc-a68c-493c-b023-6ccd351a26ad)

**Hail, timeâ€™s wayfarer.** Thou art a most worthy soul, judging by the tomes thou dost bear. 

But soft! What if thou couldst keep account of every tome thou hast perused without so much as raising a quill?
Permit me to unveil unto thee this marvel of the two-and-twentieth century: the library digital.
_(Translated by [Shakespeare](https://openl.io/translate/shakespearean)_)

### Features:
- Have the title, author, and page count for each of thy books inscribed upon a cover of leather [^1]
- Bestow thy thumb (up or down) to books thou hast or hast not read
- Cast away volumes from thy library with but a simple click

### Technical details:
This app was my submission for the [Library Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) in TOP's[^2] Fullstack Javascript path.

#### Premise
Create an app that allows users to maintain a digital "library" of books. Users should be able to add/remove records to/from the library. Each record of a book should show its title, author, page count, and read status (whether the user has read the book).
